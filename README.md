# AdventofCode2022
Current progress for the Advent of Code 2022

This is just my work for the Advent of Code, a once a year series of coding problems given at https://adventofcode.com/
I will be updating this with my solutions as I go through each of the problems. I did make an error with my first few attempts at this, so I am currently updated this with the correct files. The correct files will be in the individual folders for the day

I will also be going through and updating some of the files with a short description fo the problem I am trying to solve when I get the chance
